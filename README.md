# Jordanian Driving Training Center (JDTC)

As part of my graduation project, I developed a website called "Jordanian Driving Training Center" using Node.js and React. This project aimed to enhance the learning experience for driving school students by providing them with a convenient platform for taking driving exams and booking driving lessons with professional trainers.

The website incorporated a user-friendly interface that allowed students to access the platform easily. Students could take driving exams online, which not only saved time but also provided them with an opportunity to practice and assess their knowledge before the actual exam. The system ensured a secure and reliable environment for conducting these exams.

Additionally, the website featured a booking system that enabled students to schedule driving lessons with experienced trainers. This functionality allowed students to select their preferred time slots and trainers based on availability and expertise. It facilitated efficient communication between students and trainers, enhancing the overall learning experience.

Throughout the development process, I leveraged the power of Node.js and React to build a robust and responsive website. I implemented best practices to ensure efficient code structure, optimized performance, and seamless user interaction.

By creating the "Jordanian Driving Training Center," I aimed to address the needs of driving school students and provide them with a modern and efficient platform for their learning journey. This project showcased my skills in web development, specifically in Node.js and React, while also demonstrating my ability to understand and fulfill user requirements.
